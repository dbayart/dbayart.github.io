> Yeah, my CV is now online, and ready to be linked to other websites !

I did a CV page, not because I needed it, but because I wanted to play with new librairies.

I did it absolutely from scratch, only using [JQuery][], [Bootstrap][], [Font-Awesome][] and [Masonry][] libraries/plugins, combined with CSS and pure Javascript.

* I started to work with a JSon file, based on the standardized [JSon Resume][] layout.
* This JSon file is read, then the whole page is dynamically constructed, strictly respecting the JSon structure.
* A bit of tuning with Bootstrap tags (for the panels and the cloud of tags), some Font-Awesome icons and a layout managed with Masonry, and here is [the result][].

Of course, it's not finished yet, as I want to improve the display of the dates, and other few tweaks here and there.

_The next step: play with the [Flickr API][] to dynamically render a gallery page !_
