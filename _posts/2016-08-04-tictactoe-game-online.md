First game online !

> Tic Tac and what ?!

TicTacToe ! That well known game opposing 2 players, trying to align crosses and circles in boxes.

In this game, you're printing the X and the computer prints the O. The first one who succeed to align 3 of its symbol wins !  
The first player is randomly choosen at the begining.

Let's [try that TicTacToe game][] now !

> It's too much simple, improve it !

Here are few things I would like to improve :

* rework how the Artificial Intelligence works
* add some options, like the level of the computer AI
* add the possibility to increase the size of the grid
* allow the user to change the basic rules

_Feel free to give me some ideas in the comments below ! ;)_
